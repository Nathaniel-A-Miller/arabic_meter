# Arabic meter identification script

WIP. This script provides the basic structure to identify the meter.
In order to use it, click on Arabic_meter.ipynb above for a preview and 
click the "Run in Colab" badge to run. You will need to Run All and
input a half line (hemistich) of completely vocalized Arabic poetry written
in prosodic orthography.

The first markdown cell in the notebook explains what this means 
and provides sample hemistichs for you to try, but the script will work
with any of the six common meters I've included so far. After you input
your hemistich and run all cells, scroll down to the final cell to see the
result.
