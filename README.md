# Arabic meter identification script

WOP. This script provides the basic structure to identify the meter.
In order to use it, you will need to Run All and input a half line (hemistich)
of completely vocalized Arabic poetry written in prosodic orthography.

The first markdown cell in the notebook explains what this means 
and provides sample hemistichs for you to try, but the script will work
with any of the six common meters I've included so far. After you input
your hemistich and run all cells, scroll down to the final cell to see the
result.
